        <p class="text"> <strong>The Ninth Wave</strong> is an 1850 painting by the Russian Armenian marine painter
            Ivan Aivazovsky. It is his best-known work.
            The title refers to an old sailing expression referring to a
            wave of incredible size that comes after a succession of incrementally larger waves.
            It depicts a sea after a night storm and people facing death attempting to save themselves by clinging to
            debris from a wrecked ship.
            The debris, in the shape of the cross, appears to be a Christian metaphor for salvation from the earthly
            sin.
            The painting has warm tones, which reduce the sea's apparent menacing overtones and a chance for the people
            to
            survive seems plausible. This painting shows both the destructiveness and beauty of nature.</p>
